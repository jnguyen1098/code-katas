Because it's the largest, we know that it will be the weakest link when it comes to \"aligning\" at a certain time (a bus ID, 2, in another case, would satisfy every other timestamp - but 59 is an extremely fickle number and would only satisfy every 59 timestamps). Then, at every step of the highest bus ID, we check whether every other bus can exist at their offsets. This would involve \"reshaping\" the displacement array as follows.\n",

    "- Bus 59 would depart at some timestamp `t`\n",
    "- Bus 31 would depart at some timestamp `t + 2`\n",
    "- Bus 19 would depart at some timestamp `t + 3`\n",
