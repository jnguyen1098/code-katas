    "One important thing to notice is that we can make some optimizations based off the fact that columns are static (i.e., if ticket #1 column 1 is \"height\", then every other ticket's column 1 is \"height\" too).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hashing\n",
    "The thing stopping us from doing a pure interval reduction is the fact that rules have two intervals, unfortunately. But I think we can still use interval reduction as a means of smoke testing, similar to how hashing works:\n",
    "- Take every column and reduce it to an interval based on the min and max value\n",
    "  - For example, the column `[4, 5, 9, 1, 15, 14, 13]` would be of the interval `[1, 15]`\n",
    "- Use this interval as a hash for the column\n",
    "  - For the column above, we can be certain for a fact that it will fail the rule `height: 0-1 or 3-4`\n",
    "  - However, for the same column, we can't make an immediate deduction on the rule `height: 0-1 or 14-15` because even though the column matches the interval, this property is **necessary, but not sufficient**. Therefore, we would have to continue to manually test it. We would find that the column does fail, because the value 4 isn't allowed.\n",
    "    - You will see this \"smoke test\" line of logic in the pumping lemma, Miller-Rabin's primality testing, and using degree sequence to screen out isomorphism between graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof by Contradiction\n",
    "This is a form of transform-and-conquer known as \"problem reduction\" (see Levitin, A.'s algorithm book for more info.) where you solve a problem using an equivalent problem (for example, in high school you use problem reduction when finding known extrema of polynomials by instead solving for its derivative - you are solving for min/max by instead solving for 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same here. Take a look at this statement:\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Every number in column $c$ satisfies rule $r$'s two intervals} \\Rightarrow \\textrm{$c$ satisfies $r$}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by taking the contrapositive, we can form an equally-consistent statement:\n",
    "$$\\textrm{There exists a single number $n$ in column $c$ that does not satisfy rule $r$'s two intervals} \\Rightarrow \\textrm{$c$ does not satisfy $r$}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't matter if the function checks if a column satisfies a rule or not - if I want the other, I can just invert it! So long as these functions are consistent and complete. This is actually how Python implements some relational operators (for example, if you override \"equals\", you don't have to override \"not equals\" because you can just invert the \"equals\" override):\n",
    "> By default, `__ne__()` delegates to `__eq__()` and inverts the result unless it is `NotImplemented`. There are no other implied relationships among the comparison operators, for example, the truth of (`x<y` or `x==y`) does not imply `x<=y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, instead of checking if a large number of integers fit within a given rule, we can instead look at a rule's disallowed integers and see if they exist within a given column. Looking at the full test input we see:\n",

    "Columns `[33, 880, 952]` and `[33, 34, 952]` both have the same range `[33, 952]`, and would move forward to validation. However, rather than checking every number in each column to see if it fits with the rule, we can just check the rejection range for the rule, which in this case is 880 through 890 - we only have to check 10 numbers, and if we represent each column as a hashset, we can check each potential rejections' existences in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ amortized time. First, let's create the column cruncher function."
